# Business Problem Statement

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Summary

The client, a mid-sized professional services firm, is experiencing rapid growth that has outpaced its internal delivery operations. While demand has increased and teams have expanded, the organization lacks consistent frameworks for execution, ownership, and performance management.

> "No one really knows who owns what anymore," said the Head of Delivery.

## ðŸš¨ Symptoms of the Problem

- Operational ambiguity across delivery teams  
- Inconsistent or duplicated decision-making processes  
- Misalignment between strategic priorities and frontline execution  
- Difficulty identifying who is accountable for what  
- Missed opportunities due to inefficiencies and unclear handoffs  

## ðŸŽ¯ What the Client Needs

Leadership is seeking a scalable, strategic solution that can:
- Diagnose the current-state operational bottlenecks  
- Align roles and responsibilities clearly across teams  
- Establish accountability through governance tools (e.g., RACI)  
- Support future growth without sacrificing service quality  

## ðŸ“ˆ Why It Matters

Without a clear operating model and role clarity, the firm risks stalled growth, employee disengagement, and erosion of its client service standards. Solving this problem is critical to protecting both operational integrity and future scalabilityâ€”especially with plans to double headcount again in the next 12 months.

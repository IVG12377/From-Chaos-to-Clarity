# Initial Hypotheses

## What we suspect may be causing the problem:

1. **Lack of role clarity** is creating duplicated efforts and decision delays  
2. **Unclear escalation paths** are preventing issues from being resolved quickly  
3. **Misalignment between delivery teams and strategic goals** is causing friction  
4. **Rapid team growth** has outpaced onboarding and process standardization  
5. **No ownership framework (e.g., RACI)** is leading to ambiguity in accountability  

These hypotheses will be validated through stakeholder interviews and operational analysis.

# 📁 Folder 06 – Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Title
Translating Strategy into Action: Implementation Plan for Seamless Execution

## 🧭 Approach
Following the strategic recommendations outlined in Folder 05, this phase ensures operational alignment, clear accountability, and timely delivery of key initiatives. We apply proven execution disciplines to drive momentum and maintain strategic integrity throughout rollout.

## 📦 Deliverables
- 📄 Workplan with timeline and key milestones (Gantt-style)
- 📊 RACI Matrix: Roles and responsibilities by workstream
- ⚠️ Risk Management Framework
- 📈 Progress Tracking Template
- 🖼️ Final case presentation (PDF)

## 🧩 Methodology
This phase is grounded in classic execution best practices:
- **Milestone-Based Planning**: Structuring delivery into achievable, time-bound phases
- **Workstream Ownership**: Aligning responsibilities using a RACI model
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identifying top execution risks and proactive safeguards
- **Dashboarding**: Establishing tracking tools to monitor KPIs and project health

## 🧠 Insights
The implementation plan ensures recommendations move from slide decks to sustainable outcomes. It gives teams clarity on *what* to do, *when*, *by whom*, and *how success is measured*.

The plan also connects back to:
- Stakeholder engagement plans (Folder 02)
- Data-driven findings (Folder 04)
- Strategic goals (Folder 05)

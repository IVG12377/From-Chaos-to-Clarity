# 📁 Folder 02 – Stakeholder Analysis

## 🧭 Purpose
This section identifies and categorizes stakeholders involved in the strategic initiative. Understanding each stakeholder’s level of influence and interest is critical to shaping a successful engagement and communication strategy.

## 🧩 Methodology

We used a standard Stakeholder Matrix to evaluate stakeholders across two axes:

- **Influence over the Project:** The power to affect project outcomes or decisions.
- **Interest in the Project:** The degree to which the stakeholder is affected by or cares about the project.

Stakeholders were grouped into four categories:
- **Manage Closely** – High influence, high interest
- **Keep Satisfied** – High influence, low interest
- **Keep Informed** – Low influence, high interest
- **Monitor Only** – Low influence, low interest

## 📊 Stakeholder Alignment Grid

The matrix below visualizes the positioning of key stakeholders. This tool guides engagement intensity and communication planning.

## 📌 Insights

- Executives such as the **VP, People Strategy** and **CHRO** fall into the *Manage Closely* category and require consistent updates and collaboration.
- Administrative and support roles fall into the *Monitor Only* category, with minimal ongoing communication.
- The matrix will be used to define communication cadences and escalation pathways in Folder 05 (Strategic Recommendations).

## ✅ Next Steps

- Link stakeholder groups to targeted engagement plans.
- Define communication frequencies and responsibilities.
- Integrate stakeholder tracking into the project governance model.

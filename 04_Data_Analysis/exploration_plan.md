# Exploration Plan

## 🔍 Objective
Identify key drivers of employee attrition from an HR dataset, and extract patterns to inform strategy and future-state design.

## 🔧 Steps
1. Load and inspect the dataset
2. Perform univariate analysis (value counts, means)
3. Explore bivariate relationships (e.g., Attrition vs Job Role)
4. Create visualizations (bar plots, histograms, heatmaps)
5. Test relationships using logistic regression
6. Summarize directional findings

## ❓ Key Questions to Answer
- Which job roles and departments are most vulnerable to attrition?
- Are satisfaction levels predictive of turnover?
- Does proximity to the office or working overtime play a role?

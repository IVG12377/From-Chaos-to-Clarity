## 📊 Analysis Performed
- Univariate and bivariate summaries
- Correlation heatmaps
- Attrition breakdown by job role, department, satisfaction, etc.
- Logistic regression model for directional feature importance

_Logistic regression was used to test feature significance. This was not a deployed model, but rather a diagnostic tool to inform hypothesis refinement._

## 🎯 Key Insights
- Roles with highest attrition: Sales Executives and Laboratory Technicians
- Environment satisfaction and work-life balance strongly correlate with retention
- Overtime and low income levels are predictive of attrition
- Certain departments have structurally higher turnover despite similar engagement scores

## 🧠 Strategic Implication
Data indicates that a universal retention strategy may fall short. Focused intervention by role and satisfaction profile will yield better ROI on retention efforts.

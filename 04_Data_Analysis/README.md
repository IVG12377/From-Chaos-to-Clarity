## 🎯 Strategic Findings

- **Sales Representatives** and **Lab Technicians** exhibit the highest attrition rates (~24–40%).
- **HR Professionals** also show elevated attrition, suggesting department-specific challenges.
- Roles like **Managers** and **Research Directors** show notably low attrition, pointing to stronger engagement or support systems.
- **Predictive modeling** confirms that **OverTime**, **Job Satisfaction**, and **Years at Company** are top attrition predictors.

# Problem Statement  
**Client Strategy Engagement: Scaling Operations with Data-Driven Process Design**

## üß≠ Client Overview
The client is a mid-sized professional services firm experiencing rapid growth due to recent success in expanding its client base and service offerings. With new business units launching and cross-functional teams being formed quickly, the organization is under pressure to deliver consistent value while managing internal complexity.

## ‚ùó The Business Challenge
Despite growth, the client is facing significant delivery inefficiencies. Workflows are inconsistent, roles are unclear, and there is no standardized approach to managing cross-functional initiatives. Employees are unclear on decision rights, leading to duplicated efforts, delays, and stakeholder frustration.

Key symptoms reported by leadership include:
- Blurred ownership across departments for critical processes
- Delayed project execution due to lack of coordination
- Inconsistent data reporting on team performance
- Low morale due to unclear expectations and misaligned priorities

These challenges are undermining the firm‚Äôs ability to scale effectively while maintaining service quality, employee engagement, and profitability.

## üîç Project Scope
This strategic engagement is designed to:
- Analyze the root causes behind delivery and coordination breakdowns
- Map out current vs. desired state of operations and accountability
- Use frameworks such as RACI and stakeholder mapping to bring role clarity
- Build a mock dataset to simulate operational performance metrics
- Deliver a data-backed roadmap to drive scalable, repeatable operational excellence

## üéØ Engagement Objectives
1. **Establish Operational Clarity**  
   Introduce standardized role accountability through a RACI matrix and current-state process mapping.

2. **Diagnose Root Causes**  
   Use tools like the 5 Whys and stakeholder analysis to uncover systemic issues contributing to inefficiency.

3. **Model the Opportunity**  
   Build mock datasets to highlight bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or missed opportunities.

4. **Deliver Strategic Insights**  
   Present findings through a concise, executive-ready summary using Power BI visuals, Excel analysis, and strategic recommendations.

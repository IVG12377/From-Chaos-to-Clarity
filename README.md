# Client Strategy Engagement: Scaling Operations with Data-Driven Process Design  
**From Chaos to Clarity**

This repository showcases a simulated consulting engagement modeled on real-world strategy challenges faced by professional services firms undergoing rapid growth. It is designed to demonstrate practical expertise across business analysis, project management, and data-driven storytelling — using tools like Excel, Power BI, and SQL to bridge strategy and execution.

## 🧭 Project Overview

### Client Context
The client is a mid-sized professional services firm seeking to scale its delivery operations while maintaining excellence in service quality and employee engagement. Recent growth has outpaced their internal processes, resulting in operational ambiguity, inconsistent decision-making, and unclear accountability across teams.

### Business Problem
The client has no unified framework for assigning ownership of processes or measuring performance across delivery teams. Strategic priorities are misaligned with day-to-day execution, leading to inefficiencies and lost opportunities. Leadership is looking for a solution that can diagnose current-state challenges and provide a roadmap for scalable operational improvement.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Diagnose root causes** of inefficiencies using qualitative and quantitative frameworks (e.g., 5 Whys, stakeholder analysis).
- **Clarify ownership and accountability** through RACI modeling and process mapping.
- **Use data analysis** to simulate performance baselines and identify optimization opportunities.
- **Design a scalable operating model** that aligns people, process, and priorities.
- **Deliver insights and recommendations** in executive-friendly formats.

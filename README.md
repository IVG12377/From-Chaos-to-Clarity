# 🌀 From Chaos to Clarity: A Strategy & Data Analytics Consulting Case Study

Welcome to **From Chaos to Clarity**, a self-directed consulting simulation that demonstrates how structured problem-solving, stakeholder alignment, and data storytelling can transform organizational ambiguity into clarity and action. This end-to-end project mirrors real-world consulting workflows — from scoping through execution.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Translate a vague business challenge into a structured consulting engagement  
- Apply PMP-based frameworks to plan, track, and manage the engagement  
- Conduct business-relevant data analysis to inform strategic decisions  
- Develop actionable recommendations using consulting methodologies  
- Deliver executive-ready presentations and implementation assets

## 🧩 Client Case Overview

### Client Context
A mid-sized professional services firm has grown quickly but informally. Leadership reports unclear decision rights, inconsistent execution, and disengaged mid-tenure employees.

### Business Problem
The organization lacks a unified framework to define ownership, measure outcomes, or align execution with strategy. A consulting partner is needed to assess the current state, uncover drivers of attrition, and design a roadmap to scale delivery operations with clarity and control.

## 🧭 Why It Matters

This project simulates a real-world management consulting engagement — one that spans ambiguity, analytics, and delivery. It reflects the style of work found in Big 4 consulting, boutique strategy firms, and internal transformation teams.

The goal is not just to analyze — but to deliver clarity, alignment, and results.

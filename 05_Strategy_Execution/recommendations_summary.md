## 1. Implement a Targeted Retention Program for Sales Representatives

**Rationale:** Sales Representatives exhibit the highest attrition rate (~40%) across all roles, with data pointing to burnout and lack of career mobility as key drivers.  
**Impact:** Stabilize frontline revenue generation by addressing role-specific challenges through improved compensation design, career pathing, and manager support.  
**See Implementation Plan:** [Initiative 1 in Strategic Plan](strategic_plan.md#initiative-1-targeted-retention-program-for-sales-representatives)

## 2. Re-Engineer Early Tenure Experience

**Rationale:** Employees with less than 3 years at the company showed significantly higher attrition, often paired with lower satisfaction scores.  
**Impact:** Reduce first-year turnover through a redesigned onboarding program, structured manager check-ins, and clearer early-career growth paths.  
**See Implementation Plan:** [Initiative 2 in Strategic Plan](strategic_plan.md#initiative-2-early-tenure-experience-overhaul)

## 3. Launch a Manager Enablement Initiative

**Rationale:** Department-level attrition rates correlate strongly with team-level satisfaction and perceived manager support.  
**Impact:** Equip managers with data tools, retention playbooks, and coaching to proactively address attrition risk in their teams.  
**See Implementation Plan:** [Initiative 3 in Strategic Plan](strategic_plan.md#initiative-3-manager-enablement-program)

## 4. Monitor Workload and Overtime Patterns Proactively

**Rationale:** OverTime was among the top predictors of attrition across roles and departments.  
**Impact:** Implement real-time workload dashboards and pulse surveys to catch burnout signals early and reallocate resources accordingly.  
**See Implementation Plan:** [Initiative 4 in Strategic Plan](strategic_plan.md#initiative-4-workload--overtime-monitoring)

## 5. Institutionalize Attrition Risk Modeling

**Rationale:** Logistic regression identified consistent attrition predictors such as OverTime, Job Satisfaction, and Tenure.  
**Impact:** Build an internal dashboard that flags at-risk employees, enabling targeted intervention before resignations occur.  
**See Implementation Plan:** [Initiative 5 in Strategic Plan](strategic_plan.md#initiative-5-attrition-risk-modeling)
